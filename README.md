**Lab 1 part 1 - Array**

* Initiate two integer arrays, x, and y, each containing 5 numbers.
* Create another array z of length 5, the elements of which are the max of the respective numbers of the two arrays x and y.
* Organize a nice-looking output to the terminal that looks like the following:
Array x = { array x values here separated by coma }

Array y = { array y values here separated by coma }

Array z = x + y = { array z values here separated by coma }

**Lab 1 part 2 - ArrayList**

* Initiate an ArrayList that contain 5 names
* Switch the first and last letters in each name in the ArrayList. Do not forget that each name begins with a capital letter, but the other letters are lowercase. The names with switched letters should follow the same rule as there are new names.
* Organize a nice-looking output to the terminal that looks like the following:
Names = { list of names here separated by coma }

Names (switched) = { list of names with switched first and last letters here separated by coma }
